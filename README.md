# Programming pause

- This program was made in `Python`, and modern `Tkinter` was used as the GUI.
- If you have `Python` installed, and want to avoid running the program from a code editor (IDLE, VSCode, Pycharm...), it is enough to change the extension of your file from `.py` to `.pyw` and it will be opened directly from (Windows) File Explorer by double-clicking.
- If you want the `.exe` version, then for Windows users, in "Command Prompt" (cmd), navigate to the folder where the file with the .py extension is located and then type:
`pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole name_of_file.py`

of course, instead of name_of_file, you type the name of your file (for example `programming_pause.py`).
